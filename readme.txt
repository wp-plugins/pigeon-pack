= SPAM Laws =

Pigeon Pack enables you to own and operate your own email campaign manager. You have full control and ownership over your email lists, campaigns, autoresponders, and more. Due to this, you are also required to follow the SPAM laws, guidelines and recommendations for your country. The plugin is setup to meet compliance with current laws, however, you have the responsibility to know the laws and make sure you are using the plugin appropriately. For more information about the SPAM laws in your country, see the list below or google "SPAM LAWS" for your country.

= Email Sending Limits =

Every web host and SMTP provider has limits on the numbers of messages that can be sent from their systems. Please check with your web host or SMTP provider to verify their email limit policy. This is important to ensure you setup the plugin properly to prevent your customers from missing emails. If you anticipate sending large amount of email campaigns, there are services out there that you can use with Pigeon Pack, such as Amazon's Simple Email Service (SES). Amazon SES lets you send bulk and transactional email to customers in a quick and cost-effective manner.
